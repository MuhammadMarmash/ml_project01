Neural networks and deep learning have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling computers to learn hierarchical representations of data through multiple layers of artificial neurons. Inspired by biological neural systems, artificial neural networks consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers that process and transform information. Deep learning refers to neural networks with many hidden layers that automatically discover increasingly abstract features from raw input data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.

The fundamental building block is the artificial neuron, which receives weighted inputs, sums them, applies an activation function like ReLU or sigmoid, and produces an output. Networks are trained using backpropagation, an algorithm that calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to network weights and updates them using optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent, Adam, or RMSprop. This iterative process adjusts billions of parameters to minimize prediction errors on training data.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at computer vision tasks by using specialized layers that detect spatial patterns through convolution operations, pooling for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. CNNs power image recognition, object detection, facial recognition, and medical image analysis. Their ability to learn hierarchical visual features automatically—from edges and textures to complex objects—has achieved superhuman performance on many vision tasks.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) process sequential data by maintaining internal state across time steps. These architectures excel at natural language processing, speech recognition, time series prediction, and any task involving temporal dependencies. Transformer architectures, introduced in 2017, revolutionized sequence modeling through self-attention mechanisms, enabling models like BERT and GPT to achieve breakthrough performance in language understanding and generation.

Deep learning requires substantial computational resources, typically leveraging GPUs or specialized hardware like TPUs for parallel matrix operations. Training large models demands massive datasets and can take days or weeks on powerful hardware. Transfer learning addresses this by using pre-trained models on new tasks with limited data. Despite computational costs and data requirements, deep learning's ability to automatically learn complex patterns from raw data has made it the dominant approach for perception tasks and a key driver of modern AI progress.
